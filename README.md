# NoteIt #
## Project created as a final assignment for Languages and Tools for Programming II course ##

### Problem ###
During the lecture teachers often present previously prepared presentation as a teaching aid. Later it is usually possible for students to download the slides in PDF. All diligent students know, that these slides are often not enough to get a satisfactory grade  during an exam. They try to make notes during the lecture, but they do not want to copy the whole content of the slides. This results in countless references in notes to slides and later it is difficult to learn from so scattered notes. The solution might be to make notes directly on the slides, but these slides are often unavailable for students before the lecture.

### Idea ###
My program enables students to make notes to consecutive slides on their computer during the lecture and after the lecture to import PDF slides. Program would then display imported PDF slides and next to them corresponding notes.

### Functionalities ###
* Creating notes to slides and then importing these slides to the program.
* Creating notes to previously imported PDF file.
* Generating PDF document with slides and corresponding notes displayed side by side.
